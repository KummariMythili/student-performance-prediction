# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction in Online Courses

This project uses **Supervised Machine Learning** to predict whether a student will **Pass** or **Fail** an online course based on their academic and behavioral data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

With the rise of online learning, predicting student performance can help educators intervene early and improve academic outcomes. This project predicts the **pass/fail status** using various supervised learning algorithms and integrates the final model into a **Flask web application**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- `studytime` (hours of study)
- `failures` (number of past academic failures)
- `absences` (number of classes missed)
- `G1` (first period grade)
- `G2` (second period grade)
- Target: `pass_fail` (Pass = 1, Fail = 0)

The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, feature scaling, and encoding.

## ðŸ”Ž Machine Learning Models Used

The following algorithms were trained and evaluated:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **AdaBoost**
5. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

The **best model** was selected based on accuracy and further fine-tuned using **GridSearchCV**.
